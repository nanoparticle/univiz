# Univiz

Unified Visualization for Bioinformatics Analyses, or UniViz is a joint effort between Clara Nguyen and Jason Kmec of San Jose State University.
Clara completed the biology portion of the assignment, while I did the programming.

To use: go to https://univiz-bio.herokuapp.com/ and wait a few moments for the heroku container to spool up.
Then just follow the on-screen instructions.

### What does it do?
Univiz is a DNA visualization interface that implements 3 different algorithms. It allows comparison between each technique's output, 
while also accounting for users with colorblindness by allowing each color to be changed dynamically. Also, a more intuitive pan and zoom 
functionality is used than the implementation at https://squiggle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/methods.html

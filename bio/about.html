	Unified Visualization for Bioinformatics Analyses, or UniViz is a joint effort between Clara Nguyen and Jason Kmec of San Jose State University.

	In the field of bioinformatics, it is often necessary to interact with a wide variety of repositories and sources when searching for data, as well as many different tools for processing said data.
	A substantial number of these resources are very useful, but tend to lack an easily navigable interface.
	Although the necessity for progress in the field has driven the development of the toolsâ€™ functionality, we maintain that it is similarly important to ensure that the tool interface is able to clearly convey the relevant details, while also upholding a certain standard of aesthetic appeal.
